   1st version 
   The program implements a real-life shopping list, where the customers adds the item he/she wants to their cart
    and then the program outputs the items bought, along with their prices and adjusts the inventory accordingly.
    2nd version
    Modification for the program so that adding items to the shopping basket doesn't
    actually reduce the stock count but, instead, reserves the requested
    number of items.
    "reserved" field is added to the StockItem class to store the
    number of items reserved.The stock count for each item is reduced when a basket is checked out, at which
    point all reserved items in the basket have their actual stock count reduced. Once checkout is complete, the contents of the basket are cleared.
    "unreserve" items option is also added that were added to the basket by mistake.
    The program prevents any attempt to unreserve more items than were
    reserved for a basket.
    After checking out the baskets, the full stock list and the contents of each
    basket that has been created is being displayed.
